# Basic-Banking-System

◇ This Repo showcases my project, that I've created for my Internship task at The Sparks Foundation.

◇ This is a simple dynamic website that simulates a basic banking system. It provides users with a user-friendly interface to perform various banking operations. With this website, users can view detailed information about customers, transfer money between customers, and keep track of all transaction history.

◇ The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the functionality of a basic banking system, showcasing how customers can interact with the system to manage their funds. By accessing the website, users can easily navigate through different pages and perform transactions seamlessly.

◇ One of the key features of this website is the ability to view customer details. Users can explore a list of customers and access individual customer profiles to gain insights into their personal information, such as their name, email address, and current balance. This feature provides a comprehensive overview of the customer base and enables users to make informed decisions during transactions.

◇ Another significant functionality of this website is the money transfer feature. Users can initiate transfers between customers by selecting a source customer and specifying the recipient. This allows for seamless transactions between users, simulating real-world banking operations. The website ensures the accuracy and security of transactions by updating the balances of both the source and recipient customers and maintaining a record of the transaction in the database.

◇ Additionally, the website keeps track of all the transactions made within the system. This transaction history feature allows users to review past transfers and monitor the flow of funds between customers. It provides transparency and helps users keep a record of their financial activities.

◇ Overall, this dynamic website provides a user-friendly and efficient platform for basic banking operations. It is designed to offer a seamless user experience, allowing users to view customer details, transfer money securely, and track their transaction history conveniently.
